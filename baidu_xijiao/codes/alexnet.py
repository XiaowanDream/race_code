"""Contains a model definition for AlexNet.

This work was first described in:
  ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
  Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey E. Hinton

and later refined in:
  One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks
  Alex Krizhevsky, 2014

Here we provide the implementation proposed in "One weird trick" and not
"ImageNet Classification", as per the paper, the LRN layers have been removed.

Usage:
  with slim.arg_scope(alexnet.alexnet_v2_arg_scope()):
    outputs, end_points = alexnet.alexnet_v2(inputs)

  Described in: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5997v2.pdf
  Parameters from:
  github.com/akrizhevsky/cuda-convnet2/blob/master/layers/
  layers-imagenet-1gpu.cfg

  Note: All the fully_connected layers have been transformed to conv2d layers.
        To use in classification mode, resize input to 224x224. To use in fully
        convolutional mode, set spatial_squeeze to false.
        The LRN layers have been removed and change the initializers from
        random_normal_initializer to xavier_initializer.

  Args:
    inputs: a tensor of size [batch_size, height, width, channels].
    num_classes: number of predicted classes.
    is_training: whether or not the model is being trained.
    dropout_keep_prob: the probability that activations are kept in the dropout
      layers during training.
    spatial_squeeze: whether or not should squeeze the spatial dimensions of the
      outputs. Useful to remove unnecessary dimensions for classification.
    scope: Optional scope for the variables.

  Returns:
    the last op containing the log predictions and end_points dict.
